Identify genres with higher median scores and smaller ranges, indicating more reliable high quality.  Pay attention to age certifications;  prioritize age categories with high average IMDB scores to maintain user satisfaction across all demographics.\n",

        "3. **Optimize content planning and resource allocation:** Analyze content release trends to anticipate future demand.  Plan content acquisition and production strategically according to this, adjusting resource allocation (staff, budget, and technical infrastructure) accordingly. Periods of high content availability require increased resources; periods of lower content availability require adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Refine recommendation algorithms:** Incorporate IMDB scores, TMDB popularity, and genre information to improve the recommendation engine.  This ensures users are recommended high-quality, relevant content that caters to their preferences.\n",

        "5. **Targeted marketing:** Create targeted marketing campaigns for specific genres, age certifications, and regions. Highlight high-quality content and promote it based on the identified trends.\n",
